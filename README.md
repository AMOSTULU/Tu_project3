What were some challenges you faced while making this app?

Integrating Frontend and Backend: Ensuring smooth communication between the React frontend and the Node.js backend was a significant challenge. This involved handling CORS issues, correctly formatting requests and responses, and managing state based on asynchronous data.

User Authentication: Implementing secure and efficient user authentication using JWT and bcrypt for password hashing presented its complexities. It was crucial to ensure the security of user data while maintaining a seamless user experience.

Handling Images: Managing image uploads, especially converting them to Base64 and ensuring they are correctly stored and retrieved, was a technical challenge.

State Management in React: Maintaining the application state, particularly around the filtered tweets and search functionality, required careful state management to avoid bugs like the 'map is not a function' error.

Database Operations: Ensuring robust and efficient interactions with MongoDB, particularly in CRUD operations, was essential. This involved dealing with MongoDB’s native drivers and Mongoose ORM.


Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make?

Real-time Updates: Implementing WebSocket’s or similar technology for real-time updates of tweets without needing to refresh the page.

Improved Search Functionality: Adding more advanced search capabilities, such as filtering by date or hashtag.

Responsive Design: Enhancing the UI/UX design for better responsiveness across different devices.

User Profiles: Expanding user functionalities, including profile customization and the ability to follow other users.

More Interactive UI: Adding features like liking and commenting on tweets.

What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?


User Behavior: Assumed that users would interact with the application primarily for viewing, posting, and editing tweets.

Technical Environment: Assumed a standard web development environment and a MongoDB database.

User Authentication: Assumed that basic authentication and security measures would suffice for the scope of this application.

How long did this assignment take to complete?
